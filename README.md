# Number-guessing-script
This script asks for a number and then it will try and guess it using some algorithms.

## how to start it
it is very simple. either open it in vscode, an press f5, or opennit directly in python.

## requirements
python 3.XX

windows 10/11

(i haven't really tested it on lower versions when it comes to python and windows but it should be fine, because it only uses the random library)
